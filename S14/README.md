DETR
-----
DETR is short for DEtection TRansformer, and consists of a convolutional backbone (ResNet-50 or ResNet-101) followed by an encoder-decoder Transformer. It can be trained end-to-end to perform object detection (and panoptic segmentation, for that see my other notebooks in my repo Transformers-tutorials).The main contribution of DETR is its simplicity: compared to other models like Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN, which rely on several highly engineered things like region proposals, non-maximum suppression procedure and anchor generation, DETR is a model that can simply be trained end-to-end, and fine-tuned just like you would fine-tune BERT. This is possible due to the use of a clever loss function, the so-called bipartite matching loss

The architecture of DETR has three main components, which are a CNN backbone to extract a compact feture representation, encoder-decoder transformer, Feed-Forward Netoworks.

Bipartite loss, and why we need it
------------------------------------

Issue with Existing Loss function in Object Detection :

Existing object detection models label bounding boxes by matching multiple bounding boxes to one ground truth box with considering the ordering  . 
We are using NMS for above task and this will increase overlapping bounding boxes in image .The predicted results are a set of N predictions. Comparing this N predictions to the ground truth set is non trivial. To assess the loss an optimal Bipartite matching is created between predicted labels and ground truth. This is done by minimizing matching loss between a tupleâ€™s elements by picking one element from predicted labels and another element from ground truth.Once we have this bipartite mapping we can calculate a loss called Hungarian Loss. Bipartite matching loss is designed based on Hungarian algorithm
