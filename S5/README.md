Data Overview


MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") dataset of computer vision. The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Half of the training set and half of the test set were taken from NIST's training dataset, while the other half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from NIST's testing dataset.This project implements a beginner classification task on MNIST dataset with a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model.

  This project will automatically dowload and process the MNIST dataset
  
  Design the model architecture for MNIST with following constraint :
    
    99.4% validation accuracy
    Less than 10k Parameters
    Less than 15 Epochs
