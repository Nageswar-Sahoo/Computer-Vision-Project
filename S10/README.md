# Session - 10 Assignment -B




Part 2
## Requirement

Download  COCO object detection dataset's schema text file.

Identify the values present in the dataset.

Display class distribution with a graph.

Calculate the Anchor Boxes for k = 3, 4, 5, 6 and draw them.


## Analysis

The coco data set has set of image information like image size (Height and Width), labels(Class - ID) and bonding box(Diagonal co-ordinates). 

There are 79 classes and the class distribution graph is as below -

The data set was loaded as a dataframe in a notebook and the bonding box size (Height and Width) was calculated using the diagonal coordinates. The bonding box was then plotted with one corner being (0,0) as a scattered plot.

KMeans clustering algorithm was run on X,Y coordinates to find the optimum number of clusters

Then, for cluster values = 3,4,5,6 the centroids were calculated and anchor boxes were generated.
